_How long can you last in the Bullet Box? Remember, every shot matters..._

# TL;DR

This first person shooter can be played as many times as you want, try and reach your own high score!

You're in a box, with seemingly some bad goblins, but you'll soon realize they're not the ones that are the most threatening to you...

# About

48 hours, Ludum Dare 54' compo. The art assets are from Unreal Engine Marketplace, but the music, sound effects, and programming were all done in 48 hours. All code/blueprints were made from scratch within the timeframe. It's also my first time going solo in a game jam, and my first time using Unreal for an actual game! Super happy I have at least something to show for. 

**Engine:** Unreal Engine 5.3

**Music:** Ableton Studio + my MIDI keyboard

**Fuel:** Funk music + Lots and lots of caffeine

There's so much I wanted to add to the game but didn't have the time. I think the idea has a lot of potential, and I want to expand it on but alas 48 hours is only so long so another time then. 

### CONTROLS 
- WASD (or gamepad) to move
- Space (or :a: ) to jump
- Mouse or Joystick to aim
- Hold Left Click or LTrigger to charge
- Release Left Click of LTrigger to fire
- Esc/P or Select to pause
